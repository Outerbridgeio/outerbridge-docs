# Host Outerbridge via AWS

## Launch EC2 Instance
This walkthrough will skip how to launch an EC2 instance. There's plenty of resources and tutorial on how to do that.
In this case we are launching a EC2 instance with t2.micro.

After EC2 instance has successfully spinned up, SSH into EC2 instance.

## Install Node
1. ```bash
   curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.34.0/install.sh | bash
   ```

2. ```bash
   . ~/.nvm/nvm.sh
   ```
   
3. ```bash
   nvm install --lts
   ```

## Install Yarn
```bash
npm install yarn -g
```

## Install Lerna
```bash
npm install -g lerna
```

## Install MongoDB
Follow [instruction](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-amazon)

1. ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/yum.repos.d/mongodb-org-6.0.repo
   ```
   
2. Copy paste the following into the file you just created above:
   ```bash
   [mongodb-org-6.0]
   name=MongoDB Repository
   baseurl=https://repo.mongodb.org/yum/amazon/2/mongodb-org/6.0/x86_64/
   gpgcheck=1
   enabled=1
   gpgkey=https://www.mongodb.org/static/pgp/server-6.0.asc
   ```
   Ctrl+X to exit, press Y to save the file.

3. ```bash
   sudo systemctl start mongod
   ```

4. ```bash
   sudo systemctl status mongod
   ```

5. ```bash
   sudo systemctl enable mongod
   ```

## Install Git
```bash
sudo yum install git -y
```

## Install pm2
```bash
npm install pm2 -g
```

## Setup the project
Two ways to setup:

### Install Outerbridge via NPM:
1. ```bash
   npm install -g outerbridge
   ```

2. ```bash
   npx outerbridge start
   ```

3. App is now ready on port 3000.

4. To view the app, create 2 new inbound rules on the EC2 instance. Custom TCP Port 3000 that allows anywhere to access.

5. You can then view the app: `<Your Public IPv4 DNS>`:3000. Example: `http://ec2-18-222-246-22.eu-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com:3000`.


### Install via Github

1. ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Outerbridgeio/Outerbridge.git
   ```

2. ```bash
   cd Outerbridge
   ```

3. ```bash
   yarn bootstrap
   ```
   Depending on your RAM size, for t2.micro this could take a while.

4. ```bash
   yarn build
   ```

5. ```bash
   yarn start
   ```

6. App is now ready on port 3000.

7. To view the app, create 2 new inbound rules on the EC2 instance. Custom TCP Port 3000 that allows anywhere to access.

8. You can then view the app: `<Your Public IPv4 DNS>`:3000. Example: `http://ec2-18-222-246-22.eu-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com:3000`.


## Troubleshoot yarn bootstrap

In cases where t2.micro is taking forever on `yarn bootstrap`, here is the workaround:

1. Install the dependencies of each package independently. `cd` into each package: `ui`, `components` and `server` and do `yarn install` for each of them.

2. Back to the Outerbridge root path, do `yarn bootstrap`. Because the dependencies have been installed, the operation could be faster.


## Troubleshoot yarn build

Most of the time, it is stuck at building the `ui` folder. As a temporary workaround:

1. Back to your EC2 home path (/home/ec2-user/) and do 
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Outerbridgeio/OuterbridgeUIBuild.git
   ```

2. Copy the build folder to Outerbridge ui folder:
   ```bash
   cp -r OuterbridgeUIBuild/build/ Outerbridge/packages/ui/
   ```

3. ```bash
   cd Outerbridge
   ```

4. Build `server` and `components` independently. `cd` into package: `components` and `server` and do `yarn build` for each of them.

5. Back to the Outerbridge root path, do `yarn start` to see if app can be started.


## Troubleshoot permission to start

If you run into issue where `./run permission denied`. Do:
```bash
chmod -R 777 Outerbridge
```
to allow full access on the Outerbridge folder.


## Using NGINX

If you want to get rid of the :3000 on the url and have a custom domain, you can use NGINX to reverse proxy port 80 to 3000
So user will be able to open the app using your domain. Example: `http://yourdomain.com`.

1. ```bash
   sudo amazon-linux-extras install -y nginx1
   ```

2. ```bash
   nginx -v
   ```
   
3. ```bash
   sudo systemctl start nginx
   ```

4. ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/nginx/conf.d/outerbridge.conf
   ```

5. Copy paste the following and change to your domain:
   ```bash
   server {
       listen 80;
       listen [::]:80;
       server_name yourdomain.com; #Example: demo.outerbridge.io

       location / {
           proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
           proxy_http_version 1.1;
           proxy_set_header Host $host;
           proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
           proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
           proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
       }
   }
   ```

6. ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart nginx
   ```

7. Go to your DNS provider, and add a new A record with IP address using Public IPv4 address from EC2 instance.

8. You should now be able to open the app: `http://yourdomain.com`.

9. You can proceed to delete the 2 custom ports 3000 TCP inbound rules. They won't be needed anymore.


## Install Certbot to have HTTPS

If you like your app to have `https://yourdomain.com`. Here is how:

1. ```bash
   sudo yum install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm
   ```

2. ```bash
   sudo yum-config-manager --enable epel 
   ```

3. ```bash
   sudo yum install certbot python2-certbot-nginx
   ```

4. ```bash
   certbot --version
   ```

5. ```bash
   sudo certbot --nginx
   ```

6. If cert expired, simply renew:
   ```bash
   sudo certbot renew --dry-run
   ```

7. You can now open the app: `https://yourdomain.com`.

## Backup MongoDB

You can backup MongoDB database into S3 bucket. Here is the [article](https://bansalnagesh.medium.com/backing-up-mongodb-on-aws-ec2-to-s3-b045b5727fd6) that can be followed:

1. ```bash
   sudo yum --enablerepo epel install s3cmd
   ```

2. ```bash
   s3cmd --configure
   ```

3. ```bash
   sudo nano mongo_backup.sh
   ```

4. Copy paste and replace values:
   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
 
   #Force file syncronization and lock writes
   mongo admin --eval "printjson(db.fsyncLock())"

   MONGODUMP_PATH="/usr/bin/mongodump"
   MONGO_DATABASE="dbname_here" #replace with your database name

   TIMESTAMP=`date +%F-%H%M`
   S3_BUCKET_NAME="bucketname_here" #replace with your bucket name on Amazon S3
   S3_BUCKET_PATH="mongodb-backups"

   # Create backup
   $MONGODUMP_PATH -d $MONGO_DATABASE

   # Add timestamp to backup
   mv dump mongodb-$HOSTNAME-$TIMESTAMP
   tar cf mongodb-$HOSTNAME-$TIMESTAMP.tar mongodb-$HOSTNAME-$TIMESTAMP

   # Upload to S3
   s3cmd put mongodb-$HOSTNAME-$TIMESTAMP.tar s3://$S3_BUCKET_NAME/$S3_BUCKET_PATH/mongodb-$HOSTNAME-$TIMESTAMP.tar

   #Unlock database writes
   mongo admin --eval "printjson(db.fsyncUnlock())"
   #Delete local files
   rm -rf mongodb-*
   ```

5. ```bash
   bash mongo_backup.sh
   ```

6. Go to S3 bucket, you should see a tar file.

7. Setup cron
   ```bash
   crontab -e
   ```
   
8. Copy paste:
   ```bash
   #1st of every month at 9 am
   00 09 1 * * /bin/bash /home/ec2-user/mongo_backup.sh
   ```
