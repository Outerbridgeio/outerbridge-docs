# Credentials

Some nodes need to be authenticated to perform an action. For instance, API & Secret keys, Bearer Token, Email password and etc.
User can create a new set of credential to store these sensitive information. Credentials will be encrypted and stored in database. 
Credentials will automatically get decrypted when testing the node or when the node is executed in a deployed workflow.

## How credentials are encrypted and decrypted
By using an encryption key. An encryption key is generated using an environment variable `PASSPHRASE`. 
To change the default value:
1. Go to `Outerbridge/packages/server`
2. Create a .env file or modify the existing one by setting:
  ```jsx
  PASSPHRASE=<YOUR NEW PASSPHRASE>
  ```
3. Rebuild the app `yarn run build`

Encryption key will be stored under `Outerbridge/packages/server` as `encryption.key`.

    **Encryption key** is extremely important, make sure it is stored at secured location. For cloud services like AWS, consider using [AWS KMS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/rotate-keys.html) to rotate the key.

## Under the hood
Outerbridge uses [PBKDF2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBKDF2) to generate an encryption key. [AES256](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard) is used to encrypt/decrypt credentials.
