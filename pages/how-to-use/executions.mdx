There are 4 stages of Execution:
- **INPROGRESS**: When execution is still running
- **FINISHED**: When execution has finished
- **ERROR**: When there is error executing node
- **TERMINATED**: When user manually stop the deployed workflow while an execution is still running
- **TIMEOUT**: When the execution time exceeds specified timeout. To specify the timeout:
    1. Go to `Outerbridge/packages/server`
    2. Create one `.env` file or modify the existing one by setting:
        ```jsx
        EXECUTION_TIMEOUT=<MILLISECONDS>
        ```
    3. Rebuild the app `yarn run build`
