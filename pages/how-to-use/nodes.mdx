# Nodes

A node is script or function written to perform a single action.
For instance: API calls using [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios), cron jobs, set timeout, send email and etc.
This is how node works:

1. Receive inputs from user
2. Execute function using the input parameters received
3. Emit and save results

Three types of nodes in Outerbridge:

- Action Node
- Trigger Node
- Webhook Node

  It is recommended to test out every node before deploying the whole workflow
