# Get Started

## ‚ö°Quick Start

1. Install MongoDB from [here](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community?tck=docs_server).
2. `npm install -g outerbridge`
3. `npx outerbridge start`
4. Open `http://localhost:3000`

## üê≥ Docker

1. Clone the repository

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Outerbridgeio/Outerbridge.git
   ```

2. Go into `docker` folder

   ```bash
   cd Outerbridge && cd docker
   ```

3. Start Docker Compose
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```
4. This will automatically spins up mongodb and outerbridge containers
5. Open `http://localhost:3000`
6. You can bring the containers down by
   ```bash
   docker-compose stop
   ```

## üë®‚Äçüíª Developers

Outerbridge has 3 different modules in a single mono repository.

- `server`: Node backend to serve API logics
- `ui`: React frontend
- `components`: Nodes and Credentials of applications

### Prerequisite

- Install MongoDB [here](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community?tck=docs_server)
- Install Yarn
  ```bash
  npm i -g yarn
  ```

### Setup

1. Clone the repository

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Outerbridgeio/Outerbridge.git
   ```

2. Go into repository folder

   ```bash
   cd Outerbridge
   ```

3. Install `lerna`, `husky` and `rimraf` :

   ```bash
   yarn setup
   ```

4. Install all dependencies of all modules and link them together:

   ```bash
   yarn bootstrap
   ```

5. Build all the code:

   ```bash
   yarn build
   ```

6. Start the app:

   ```bash
   yarn start
   ```

   You can now access the production-ready app on `http://localhost:3000/`

7. For development build:
   ```
   yarn dev
   ```
   Any code changes will reload the app automatically on `http://localhost:8080`

## üî¶ Tunnel

<Callout type="warning" emoji="‚ö†Ô∏è">
  Beware of using Tunnel URL in production
</Callout>

By default, starting Outerbridge will also spins up a tunnel url. You can access the exact same app on this url. A console log will be shown like this:

```jsx
process.env.TUNNEL_BASE_URL = http://<domain>-<name>-<number>.loca.lt/
```

This is needed for third-party webhook integration such as Alchemy Webhook in order to reach Outerbridge on web. However it should not be used in production because anyone can access the app.
To toggle this off:

1. Go to `Outerbridge/packages/server`
2. Create one `.env` file or modify the existing one by setting:

```jsx
ENABLE_TUNNEL = false
```

3. Rebuild the app `yarn run build`
