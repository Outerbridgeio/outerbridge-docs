# Introduction to Outerbridge

**Outerbridge** is a low code/no code workflow automation application, focusing on integrating both on-chain and off-chain applications. The project is licensed under [Apache License Version 2.0](https://github.com/Outerbridgeio/Outerbridge/blob/master/LICENSE.md), source available and free to self-host.

## Why another workflow automation tool?
There are many awesome automation tools out there, however there isn't one that has the built-in logic of interacting/consuming information from blockchains. Hence, Outerbridge is created to allow people building workflows involving on-chain and off-chain applications, with simple drag and drop interface.

## Use cases
Outerbridge primary focus is on web3 developers to automate tasks after smart contracts have been deployed. However it's usage is not limited to just that. Even if you are not a web3 developer, you can still use Outerbridge to automate your tasks using the list of supported apps.
- Monitor smart contract events and functions (e.g: Transfer, Approve) and send notification via Discord, Teams, Slack or Email
- Send notification to Discord server when NFT is minted
- Notify user when a transaction does not get through on-chain
- Triggers automatic top-up if balance (e.g: BNB, ETH, Matic) dropped below certain threshold
- Keep an eye on @elonmusk tweet to see if it contains keyword "Dogecoin", if yes buy Dogecoin through Binance 😂
More to come!
